# Task Instructions

Follow these instructions to execute the task that the user asks you to.

## Executing Instructions

- Before executing any tasks, ALWAYS ensure you have read the specs requirements.md, design.md and tasks.md files; all in the same directory as the tasks.md file that the user provided. Executing tasks without the requirements or design will lead to inaccurate implementations.
- Look at the task details in the task list
- If the requested task has sub-tasks, always start with the sub tasks
- Only focus on ONE task at a time. Do not implement functionality for other tasks.
- Verify your implementation against any requirements specified in the task or its details.
- Once you complete the requested task, update the [task.md](http://task.md/) file, stop and let the user review. DO NOT just proceed to the next task in the list.

Remember, it is VERY IMPORTANT that you only execute one task at a time. Once you finish a task, stop. Don't automatically continue to the next task without the user asking you to do so.

IMPORTANT EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

- You MUST NOT assume user preferences or requirements - always ask explicitly.
- You MUST maintain a clear record of which step you are currently on.
- You MUST NOT combine multiple steps into a single interaction.
- You MUST ONLY execute one task at a time. Once it is complete, do not move to the next task automatically.
